## 📋 Assignment Description
This project focuses on building a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to identify key entities from recipe data, such as ingredient names, quantities, and units.

The assignment involves:
- Data ingestion and cleaning
- Train-validation splitting (70:30)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering for CRF
- Model building and evaluation
- Error analysis
- Reporting of results and insights

## 📝 Dataset
The dataset `ingredient_and_quantity.json` was provided with the assignment and contains ~113 recipes including ingredients, quantities, and instructions.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Place the dataset `ingredient_and_quantity.json` in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Open `Identifying_Key_Entities_Recipe_Data_Starter.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce results.
5. Export notebook as PDF and prepare report for submission.

## 📄 Files Included
- `Identifying_Key_Entities_Recipe_Data_Starter.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing full code and analysis.
- `ingredient_and_quantity.json`: Dataset used.
- `Recipe_Entity_Assignment_Submission_Report.docx`: Final report with approach, results, and insights.
  
## 🎯 Assumptions
- All recipes have consistent fields for ingredients and quantities.
- Minor text cleaning was performed (e.g., lowercase conversion, punctuation removal).
- CRF features include word shape, prefixes/suffixes, and contextual features.

## 📊 Report Requirements
The report includes:
- Problem statement
- Methodology and techniques
- Results and insights
- Assumptions made
